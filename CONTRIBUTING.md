## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### 1. Development Environment Setup

# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sebuf.git
cd sebuf

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Install development tools
make install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test
```

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... edit code ...

# Run tests and checks
make test
make lint

# Generate any necessary code

# Push and create a pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions with a few sebuf-specific guidelines:

**Go Code:**
```go
// ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive function names
func GenerateHTTPHandlers(service *protogen.Service) error {
    // Function body
}

// ✅ Good: Proper error handling
if err := generateFile(file); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to generate file %s: %w", file.Name, err)
}

// ✅ Good: Comprehensive comments for exported functions
// GenerateHelpers generates convenience constructor functions for protobuf 
// messages containing oneof fields. It processes all messages in the file
// and creates helpers for each oneof field that contains a message type.
func GenerateHelpers(plugin *protogen.Plugin, file *protogen.File) {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Protobuf Definitions:**
```protobuf
// ✅ Good: Clear service and method documentation
// UserService provides user management capabilities including
// authentication, profile management, and access control.
service UserService {
  // CreateUser registers a new user in the system.
  // Validates input, ensures email uniqueness, and sends welcome email.
  rpc CreateUser(CreateUserRequest) returns (User);
}

// ✅ Good: Descriptive field comments
message User {
  // Unique identifier for the user (UUID format)
  string id = 1;
  
  // User's email address (must be unique across the system)
  string email = 2;
}
```

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

**Unit Tests:**
```go
func TestLowerFirst(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {"empty string", "", ""},
        {"single char", "A", "a"},
        {"camelCase", "CamelCase", "camelCase"},
        {"already lower", "lowercase", "lowercase"},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := lowerFirst(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("lowerFirst(%q) = %q, want %q", tt.input, result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

**Golden File Tests** (for code generation):
```go
func TestCodeGeneration(t *testing.T) {
    // Golden file tests ensure generated code doesn't change unexpectedly
    // When intentionally changing output, run: UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 go test
    
    goldenFile := "testdata/golden/expected_output.pb.go"
    actualOutput := generateCode(inputProto)
    
    if os.Getenv("UPDATE_GOLDEN") == "1" {
        err := os.WriteFile(goldenFile, actualOutput, 0644)
        require.NoError(t, err)
        return
    }
    
    expectedOutput, err := os.ReadFile(goldenFile)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    require.Equal(t, string(expectedOutput), string(actualOutput))
}
```

### Documentation Standards

**Code Documentation:**
- All exported functions must have comprehensive comments
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document error conditions and return values

**README and Guides:**
- Use clear, action-oriented headings
- Include working code examples
- Provide troubleshooting sections
- Test all examples before submitting
